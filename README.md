## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: Application routes (Home, About, Workouts, etc.).
- `src/components/layout`: Global layout components (Navbar, Footer).
- `src/components/ui`: Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Hero, etc.).
- `src/lib`: Utility functions.

## Customization

### Adding New AOs
To add a new workout location, edit `src/app/workouts/page.tsx`. Add a new object to the `aos` array with the name, time, location, map link, and description.

### Updating Schedule
Edit the `time` field in the `aos` array in `src/app/workouts/page.tsx`.

### Changing Images
Place new images in the `public/images` folder and update the `backgroundImage` props in the page files (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/about/page.tsx`).

## Note on Icons
Due to compatibility issues with the latest Next.js/React versions, icons (Lucide React) have been temporarily disabled and replaced with emoji placeholders. To restore them, ensure `lucide-react` is compatible with React 19 and uncomment the imports and usages in the components.

## Contributing & Deployment

This repo powers the **F3 Marietta** website and AI assistant.

The site is built with:

- Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Markdown-based content in `data/content/`
- Lexicon/Exicon data in `data/` (TS/CSV)
- OpenAI embeddings + a vector index in `data/f3VectorIndex.json`
- Deployed via Vercel

### Branching & Workflow

We use a simple Git branching model:

- `main` – always deployable, production branch
- `feature/*` – new features or larger changes
- `fix/*` – bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` – urgent fixes to production behavior

Basic workflow:

1. Branch off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
2. Make changes (code, markdown, glossary, etc.).

3. Run the app locally and ensure everything works.

4. Commit with a clear, conventional message (see Commit Messages below).

5. Push your branch: 
    ## git push -u origin feature/short-description
6. Open a Pull Request into main.
7. CI must pass (GitHub Actions).
8. Once approved, merge to main → Vercel deploys automatically.
