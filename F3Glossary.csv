Best done in mulch, dirt or at edge of grass and asphalt/concrete so hands/elbows can be on grass while feet have traction. Also works well in parking lot conveyer belts when PAX are provided with small squares of cardboard left at Absolution station to protect elbows. Smart Q's will introduce this with the cadence, but then instruct PAX to do sets of 15-30 OYO (as the Q will suffer too and should avoid giving the impression of weakness to the PAX, lest he suffer insufferable mumble chatter)."
801,Exicon,Abyss Merkin,"Perform merkins on two parallel benches, right hand and foot on one bench, and left hand and foot on the other bench, letting your body lower into the space between the benches as far a possible.

""According to the folks at Guinness World Records, the start position is with hands and feet on the ground in a plank; all Elizabeth Llorente, 37, had to do when she got to the jump position was remove her hands and feet from the ground.

This concludes 1st grade.  Run the loop again, followed by the 1st grade exercise x 12 reps plus a new exercise x 12 reps.  This concludes 2nd grade. Continue with the loop and adding an exercise each time until you've completed one loop and exercise combo for each of the 12 grades.  Great for mumble chatter and telling of high school victories.

993,Exicon,Coach,"The Coach - Partner up into groups of 3. Partner 1 performs a pull up and holds in the up position while partner 2 takes on the role of the Coach. It's the Coach's responsibility to encourage P1 to give his best effort, to push through the pain, to do whatever it takes to stay in the up position while P3 sprints around the pickle (parking lot) one time. Upon P3's arrival P1 comes down from the pull up and gives P2 a high five for being a great coach. P1 will now sprint the pickle while P2, goes up on the bar. P3 is now the coach. This cycle continues until everyone has had a turn at all three positions. Repeat until all pax have lost their voices, arms have fallen off, or the Q is ready to move on."
994,Exicon,Cockroach Resurrection,"4-count ab exercise done lying down on your six and pulling your knees and arms to your chest, then rapidly extending arms and legs back out, then back in. Preferably done directly after the Dying Cockroach and with at least one extra rep."
995,Exicon,Code Red,"A call of ""Code Red"" alerts the PAX to stop and immediately execute a predetermined count and type of exercise.  The Q announces the type and count of the exercise at the beginning of the workout. Any one of the PAX can call Code Red at any point during the work out.   For example, Code Red equals 5 Burpees OYO.  This is especially entertaining when the PAX respond, ""Did you order the Code Red!?""  The appropriate answer is ""You're damn right I did!"""
997,Exicon,Colonel Trautman,Pair up and one partner runs 20 yards to the pull up bar and do 3 pull ups while the other partner does either 5 fingertip Merkins or 10 regular Merkins then hold Chillcutt for their partner to tell them to go and do their pull ups.

Reverse Conveyor Belt is the same idea but going in the reverse direction by CrawlBearing between stations. This works really nicely with kettlebells: leave your kettlebell at the station where you start."
1002,Exicon,Cooler / Super Duper Cooler,"For the Cooler... start with a side plank, resting on your forearm at 90 degrees. Legs are resting together. The exercise is done in four-count cadence. On 1, the top leg extends upward parallel to the body (as in ""right arm high, but it's your leg""). On 2, you're back to original position with legs back together. On 3, tuck the top leg toward your chest. There, the need should meet the top hand around shoulder level. On 4, you're back to original position again. Typically, Q calls out 10 on the right side, then flapjack, and perform 10 on the left. The Super Duper Cooler is the same, except you're not resting on your forearm... you're in full extension and supported only by your hand."
1003,Exicon,Copperhead Lunge,"In the same family as the Copperhead Squat, it is a stepped lunge with one leg at a time, go down further each count in a 4 count cadence."

Continue to roll away from your starting position onto your chest and complete the Burpee. This is one rep.  Next rep go back the way you came.  This gives the PAX a nice even coating of parking lot grit, grass, mud, sand, snow or whatever bilge water your AO is covered in.  This is great to call when the mumble chatter is high about the rain and getting wet.  Could use this is a mode of transportation also.  Don't go back and forth but keep rolling in one direction."
1007,Exicon,Cotton-eyed Joe,"Best accompanied by playing Cotton Eyed Joe by Rednex (3:14) Start with SSH to music when singing starts.

1013,Exicon,Crab Jacks,"Just like plank jacks, but facing the sky. Get into crab walk position, knees bent at 90 degrees and hips towards the sky. Move thighs apart and back together. Decline CJ are when feet are uphill."
1014,Exicon,Crab vs. Bear Soccer,"Preferably played on a soccer field with goals, divide into teams, one team has to crab walk while the other has to bear crawl. Once someone scores a goal, then the teams swap roles (bear to crab and crab to bear). Goalies have to plank, and goalies must be swapped out after every goal scored.

1020,Exicon,Creature Merkins,"Start in an incline merkin position with feet together on the ground hand up on seat/bench. Using feet as a pivot and keeping your body straight, move your body with your hands to the right then down to the ground to perform a merkin. Then, using hands, bring yourself back up on the seat/bench and over to the left side to perform a merkin. Q's call on how many merkins to perform on each side."

1022,Exicon,Crowd Pleaser,"Essentially a Merkin followed by a Groiner, but done as a pyramid. For regular men, going from 1:1 (1 Merkin and 1 Groiner) to 4:4 (4 Merkins followed by 4 Groiners) and back down to 1:1 may be a challenge, but average F3 men should go from 1:1 up to 5:5 and back down to 1:1 to truly enjoy the moment (at total of 25 reps of each). Working up to a 6:6 pyramid is an admirable goal for the Sugar Rays in the PAX... going any higher is not advised unless you have good disability insurance."

No stopping/resting in the sequence - it should feel like constantly jumping up and down from the burpee straight through to the jump squat. Try minimum 10 to get the burn started. 20 to make it count. 30 to make it hurt."
1026,Exicon,Cumberland County Viaduct (CCV),Basically - these are side raises. Lay on side with weight on elbow. In cadence - 1) raise hip up as high as you can. 2) back down but don't let other hip touch ground 3) raise up again 4) back down.

Right leg lunge forward (step back to center after each) / Right leg lunge sideways / Right leg lunge back / Left leg lunge back / Left leg lunge sideways / Left leg lunge forward. This completes one full Daft Punk."
1033,Exicon,Dan Taylor,"Punishing leg exercise that is a cousin (of sorts) to Jack Webb. Named after Lt. Dan in Forrest Gump, it combines 1 squat followed by 4 lunges (alternating legs) in ascending order (maintaining the 1:4 ratio). It will leave the PAX feeling like ""they ain't got no legs""."
1034,Exicon,Dancing Bear Pyramid,PAX perform 1 Merkin and then recover to perform 1 Dancing Bear (Andean Bear from Nashville Zoo on news…basically a jump squat and OHP). R&R going up until 10 & 10.

A Jack Webb starts with 1 Merkin and 2 Raise the Roofs, then the Merkins increase one at a time while the Raise the Roofs increase in that 1 to 2 ratio, so that you end with 10 Merkins and 20 Raise the Roofs.  The Dark Webb consists of all the following, done without rest: Jack Webb - 1 Merkin to 2 Raise the Roofs House of Paine - 1 Jump Squat with 2 Iron Mikes / Bonnie Blairs / Jump Lunges (one per leg) Captain Thor - 1 Big Boy with 2 American Hammers (4 count, if you want the PAX to stop complaining) Happy Jack Webb - A bad marriage between a Happy Jack and a Jack Webb - 1 Burpee with 2 Side Straddle Hops (at this point 4 count is unnecessary) This one is fairly brutal, so don't plan on getting much out of the PAX after it.  Invented by Preach from Birmingham."
1041,Exicon,Darts,"Darts (courtesy of my kids magnetic dart board)- PAX throws a dart. Q dictated what red and green exercises were each session, as well as judge on what dart hits.

Speed, order, and duration are completely at the Q's discretion, with the goal being to test the pax's reaction time and/or keep them in an uncomfortable position (esp. 6 inches or down part of Merkin). Inspired by a certain Marine at the Spring 2016 F3 Mud Run and best executed with a gruff, barking orders style. Example: ""On your face! On your six! On your face! On your six! On your feet! On your face! Down! Up! Down! Up! Down! [painful delay] Up!"""

The dumbells serve as bars for deeper merkins at the bottom and the added weight is a shoulder burner at the top. Any more than 15lbs is cruel and unusual punishment. 10 OYO should cause all mumblechatter to cease immediately due to oxygen depravity. If no dumbbells are available, hand sized rocks work well & add a stability factor."
1095,Exicon,Dustin Johnson,"DJ broke the scoring record at the 2019 Masters with a final score of 268, which was -20 (20 under par).  Thus, PAX should begin on the goal line and run 20 yards, stop & perform 2 Wolverines.

Swing your arms back to a ""T"" formation, then over your head to form a triangle, then back down to a ""T"", and then back to the starting position.  25 reps makes for a good shoulder warm up.

Pax will hold the down position until the next rep. It's only 31 little reps in 3:30. Scale this workout to your fitness level: If you are fatigued, modify the 'mericans by either doing chest to ground at the bottom, or take no shame and use your knees. Here's a tip to complete it, position hands between shoulders and chest and close to the body, much less stress on the shoulders. This can be modified to about any move; squats, curls, planks or even pull-ups if you are absolutely insane. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A2V9Bu80J4"

1390,Exicon,Non-Alternating Shoulder Taps,"Much like a combination of the Alternating Shoulder Taps (but you do not alternate) and a clap merkin (but rather than clap, you touch both shoulders). So, from the plank you go down as far as you need, probably halfway, to push up with enough force to be able to touch your right hand to your left shoulder and your left hand to your right shoulder AT THE SAME TIME, and then get your hands down in time to do some more. It is like the clap merkin, but since your hands are not under your body, it is a little scarier and you need a better push to have time to cross both arms and touch both shoulders and then get your hands down in time to not smash your face. Requires good explosive power. Good to call 10 OYO."

1402,Exicon,One Calls,"This is an 8-count IC exercise developed as a result of the sometimes horrible merkin form by some PAX, especially those claiming to do great #’s when in fact they didn’t do any correctly. It was a way to force the PAX to have FULL extension both at the bottom and the top, which only makes them better (and stops the improper form). Since I work with OneCall and he would come to the office daily to complain about this, I developed this exercise and named it after him for my upcoming Q. Start in Merkin/Plank position. 1 – Down; 2 – Hand Release; 3 – Up and hold; 4 – Floyd Mayweather Punch Right arm; 5 – Right arm down; 6 – Floyd Mayweather Punch Left arm; 7 – Left arm down; 8 (which would be the PAX count of 1, 2, 3, etc) – Full plank. As you can see, this forces the PAX to go all the way down instead of the 1-2” down that some claim count as a merkin, and it forces a locking of the elbows at the top. 10-15 of these are excellent. It has also been done with 2 PAX facing each other and keeping each other honest (Q choice with these to make the Floyd Mayweathers into Booyah Merkins or Slap 5's or anything like that where the PAX are mirroring each other)."

The name Turkish Getup Star Jumps is just way too long to say."

Continue alternating merkins and planking until one pax in the pair reaches merkin failure.  After failure each pair gets up and lunge walks in circles around the other pax pairs until the last team reaches failure.  The pairs must encourage and push each other and then encourage others while lunge walking.  Last team to fail wins.  Named pump jack because all the pax going up and down during merkins looks like a field full of oil wells with  pump jacks, and you are pumped when it is over. Proper merkin form must be used by all.  With an uneven number of pax the Q does merkins on his own."
1467,Exicon,Punch-up Merkin,"In typical Merkin postion go down and back up, then punch straight out, to the side, or up (for a real burn) 10 times with right arm. Do another merkin and repeat with left arm. Best done OYO or during a circuit routine."

1485,Exicon,Red Bull Smurf Jack,"Same as the standard smurf jack, except high-tempo cadence at 2 or 3 times the speed of a normal cadence.

1492,Exicon,Richard Simmons,"Starting position: The PAX will stand with his feet wider than shoulder width; 4-Count Execution: On the 1-count the PAX will reach towards one foot with his alternate hand, on the 2-count he will reach towards his other foot with the opposite hand, on the 3-count he will extend his hips until he is standing upright with arms at his side, on the 4-count, in a fluid motion, he will  cross his arms in front of him, raise them over his head, and then bring them down laterally, thus uncrossing them, and returning to starting position."

1513,Exicon,Sally's Cousin,"Variation of ""Bring Sally Up"" - Play ""Flower"" by Moby. Instead of the merkin position, start in a downward squat position, and hold. Each time ""bring Sally up"" is sung, stand up, and then ""bring Sally down"", go back down to the squat position. Definitely will feel the burn in your quads!"
1514,Exicon,Saluki Pushups,"This is a Tricep Dip performed on the ground with no additional elevated equipment.

Continue this running and rep routine, downward counting through to completing 6 burpees. Then, as you hit the 5-1 count reps, do Merkins instead of Burpees. After the entire 10-1 set is over, pause. Make it appear you're done. Then announce that you're reversing the order. In this new set, now you start with Merkins as your 10-6 set and finish with Burpees as 5-1.  This routine started when a Jacob's Ladder was about to occur, and the Q asked since we were going to 10, which would the PAX prefer - Merkins or Burpees? Santa answered he'd like to split halfway, so the Q obliged. Then the Q announced uneven gains required doing it again in reverse. If executed properly -- with the thought it's only a single 10-1 set -- it's even more of a real crowd pleaser."
1519,Exicon,Sasquat (Like Sasquatch but Squat),"Partner Work. Two PAX assume Wheel Barrow postions. If you are the standing PAX you should hold the down PAX's legs together, not wide. In unison down PAX performs a Merkin, and standing PAX performs a Squat. Timing is key, choose 1 PAX to call out rhythm. Its harder than it seems."

1679,Exicon,Up Straddle Hop,"So, I tore my calf the other day and have been on the IR for a bit, but did not want to miss our monthly convergence...so I grabbed my kettlebell to do some work with when the PAX were doing exercises I couldn't do and headed out to the beatdown. Circled up. First exercise called was SSH, which I did not want to do and put pressure on the torn calf, so I started hopping on one leg IC while still doing the upper body motion. Apparently, it looked funny as the PAX started laughing and then doing it themselves. 43 men hopping on one leg and waving their arms would certainly have looked awesome to any passersby! And doing 30 IC of those destroyed my right (good) leg, so I figured it might need a name? Let the PAX call it and do 25-30 IC with each leg. It burns. For good measure, the Q next called 10 OYO burpees, which I tried to do 1-legged, and after 2 had absolutely no strength left in that good leg, so that could be an add-on to the exercise."
1680,Exicon,Upright Row,"Grab a rock, concrete block, log, a kettle bell, or a small 2.0 with a close overhand grip at waist level and bring up to your chin. (Thanks Clark in NoCo.)"

1699,Exicon,Weekend at Bernie's,"This is a partner drag exercise where one partner is a ""causality"" and the other partner has to get him down the field. Any type of drag can be used for this exercise. At warthog we used bear crawls as well drags where the pax drags the causality by the ankles down the field. Reason for name is because while we were preforming this exercise many pax had flashbacks to scenes in the move where they were moving Bernie around the house."
1700,Exicon,Weezy Jefferson,"Ab exercise performed laying on back, hands under bum, legs raised to 90 degrees. In cadence, lower legs quickly towards the ground, stop legs 6 inches above ground without touching ground, and move 'em back up to 90 degrees (like you're movin' on up like George & Weezy).

1704,Exicon,Werewolf,Start in the Downward facing dog position (high plank) transition to a low plank then to upward facing dog and back to down dog in one smooth motion.

Team A takes a ball (e.g. basketball) and throws it toward their assigned target. They have four throws to make it to their target. All PAX run to where ball stops or is stopped by Team B and does an assigned exercise (e.g. 10 Merkins). If Team A hits their target in 4 throws or less, Team B does penalty burpees; if Team A misses, they do penalty burpees. Flapjack teams and targets, and switch out the exercise everyone does at the stopped ball. Great at getting some healthy competition and you will undoubtedly have a few sprinters out trying to stop the ball or protecting it."
1708,Exicon,Whamo lunge walks,"One pax throws a frisbee. All pax sprint in that direction until frisbee lands. When it lands, all PAX stop and then lunge-walk until they get to the frisbee. Can be modified with duck walk, crab walk, whatever."

Assume bear crawl position and stay there. The Attacker begins to chase his prey throughout the kill zone (in bear crawl mode). Once contact is made with PAX (""tag""), contacted PAX becomes the attacker, returns to his corner, and it starts over. Tweak the exercise with the size of the kill zone and the number of people. Variation: instead of tagging, you have to take your prey down to the ground (F3 meets jiu jitsu) which from your hands and knees should be safe."" Wide-arm Merkin,,Merkin with hands more than sholder width apart.
