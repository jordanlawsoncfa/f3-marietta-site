# What is F3?

F3 is a national network of free, peer-led workouts for men. Our mission is to plant, grow, and serve small workout groups for men for the invigoration of male community leadership.

F3 stands for **Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith**.

- **Fitness:** We start together and end together. The workouts are open to all men of all fitness levels. A core tenant of F3 is no man left behind.
- **Fellowship:** We build bonds of brotherhood that last beyond the workout. We call this the "Second F".
- **Faith:** Not a specific religion, but a belief in something bigger than yourself. We end every workout with a Circle of Trust (COT).

F3 was launched in 2011 in Charlotte, NC, and has since grown to thousands of locations across the world.
