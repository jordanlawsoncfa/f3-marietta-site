# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who is F3 for?
F3 is for men of all fitness levels. We have men in their 20s and men in their 70s. We have ultra-marathoners and men who are just getting off the couch. The only requirement is that you are a male.

## What does it cost?
F3 is always free. There are no membership fees, no dues, and no catch. We are a peer-led organization, so we don't pay instructors or rent gym space.

## What should I bring?
Wear workout clothes appropriate for the weather. We recommend bringing a pair of workout gloves (gardening or mechanic gloves work great) since we often do exercises on pavement. Bring a water bottle.

## What if I’m out of shape?
That's exactly why you should come! Our workouts are designed to be scalable. The leader (Q) will offer modifications for exercises. The most important thing is that you show up and do your best. "Modify as needed" is a core F3 principle.

## Do I need to sign up?
No. You just show up. Check the Locations page to find a workout near you and just be there a few minutes before the start time.

## Is it a religious group?
F3 stands for Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith. However, we define "Faith" not as a specific religion, but as a belief in something bigger than yourself. We are open to men of all faiths and no faith. We end each workout with a "Circle of Trust" where men can share a prayer, a quote, or just a thought, but participation is voluntary.
