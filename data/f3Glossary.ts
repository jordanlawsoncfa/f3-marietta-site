An awesome core and upper body workout that is both the solution to flabby abs, and a reason to beg absolution for your sins. Start in plank position and perform a single Groiner (cadence \"1\" jump feet forward, \"2\" jump feet back), then Mahktar N' Diayes to Chillcut position (cadence \"3\" & \"4\" with drop to each elbow), then Chilly Jack (cadence \"5\" feet out, \"6\" feet together), and finally Mahktar N' Diayes to plank starting position (cadence \"7\" and \"ONE, TWO, etc.\" with rise on each hand). Best done in mulch, dirt or at edge of grass and asphalt/concrete so hands/elbows can be on grass while feet have traction. Also works well in parking lot conveyer belts when PAX are provided with small squares of cardboard left at Absolution station to protect elbows. Smart Q's will introduce this with the cadence, but then instruct PAX to do sets of 15-30 OYO (as the Q will suffer too and should avoid giving the impression of weakness to the PAX, lest he suffer insufferable mumble chatter)."

It is a shoulder warm up that can become a full-on exercise with enough reps.  Here is its description: Four-count exercise that  begins in a standing position with your arms together, straight out in front of you.  Swing your arms back to a \"T\" formation, then over your head to form a triangle, then back down to a \"T\", and then back to the starting position.  25 reps makes for a good shoulder warm up.  At 50 reps the mumblechatter starts to dwindle.  Groans of pain begin at about rep 75,  which should be taken by the Q as encouragement to keep going to 100."

Start with your chest on the ground, and enjoy it because your chest shouldn't touch the ground again until the song is over. When the song says \"Green Sally Up\" the Pax will be in the 'Merican up position, and \"Green Sally Down\" the Pax will be in the 'Merican down position. Pax will hold the down position until the next rep. It's only 31 little reps in 3:30. Scale this workout to your fitness level: If you are fatigued, modify the 'mericans by either doing chest to ground at the bottom, or take no shame and use your knees. Here's a tip to complete it, position hands between shoulders and chest and close to the body, much less stress on the shoulders. This can be modified to about any move; squats, curls, planks or even pull-ups if you are absolutely insane. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A2V9Bu80J4"

It is like the clap merkin, but since your hands are not under your body, it is a little scarier and you need a better push to have time to cross both arms and touch both shoulders and then get your hands down in time to not smash your face.

    "shortDescription": "This is an 8-count IC exercise developed as a result of the sometimes horrible merkin form by some PAX, especially those claiming to do great #\ufffds when in fact they didn\ufffdt do any correctly. It was a way to force the PAX to have FULL extension both at the bottom and the top, which only makes them better (and stops the improper form). Since I work with OneCall and he would come to the office daily to complain about this, I developed this exercise and named it after him for my upcoming Q. Start in Merkin/Plank position. 1 \ufffd Down; 2 \ufffd Hand Release; 3 \ufffd Up and hold; 4 \ufffd Floyd Mayweather Punch Right arm; 5 \ufffd Right arm down; 6 \ufffd Floyd Mayweather Punch Left arm; 7 \ufffd Left arm down; 8 (which would be the PAX count of 1, 2, 3, etc) \ufffd Full plank. As you can see, this forces the PAX to go all the way down instead of the 1-2\ufffd down that some claim count as a merkin, and it forces a locking of the elbows at the top. 10-15 of these are excellent. It has also been done with 2 PAX facing each other and keeping each other honest (Q choice with these to make the Floyd Mayweathers into Booyah Merkins or Slap 5's or anything like that where the PAX are mirroring each other)."

    "shortDescription": "Pick a spot in the distance. Run from your starting point to that spot and do 10 Burpees. Return to start. Turnaround, run back to your spot, now do 9 Burpees. Continue this running and rep routine, downward counting through to completing 6 burpees. Then, as you hit the 5-1 count reps, do Merkins instead of Burpees. After the entire 10-1 set is over, pause. Make it appear you're done. Then announce that you're reversing the order. In this new set, now you start with Merkins as your 10-6 set and finish with Burpees as 5-1.  This routine started when a Jacob's Ladder was about to occur, and the Q asked since we were going to 10, which would the PAX prefer - Merkins or Burpees? Santa answered he'd like to split halfway, so the Q obliged. Then the Q announced uneven gains required doing it again in reverse. If executed properly -- with the thought it's only a single 10-1 set -- it's even more of a real crowd pleaser."

Circled up. First exercise called was SSH, which I did not want to do and put pressure on the torn calf, so I started hopping on one leg IC while still doing the upper body motion. Apparently, it looked funny as the PAX started laughing and then doing it themselves. 43 men hopping on one leg and waving their arms would certainly have looked awesome to any passersby! And doing 30 IC of those destroyed my right (good) leg, so I figured it might need a name? Let the PAX call it and do 25-30 IC with each leg. It burns. For good measure, the Q next called 10 OYO burpees, which I tried to do 1-legged, and after 2 had absolutely no strength left in that good leg, so that could be an add-on to the exercise."
