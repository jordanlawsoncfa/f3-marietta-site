### Definition
The rhythmic 4-count method used to keep the PAX moving in unison.

### How it's done
1. Name the exercise
2. 'Starting position... MOVE!'
3. 'In Cadence... EXERCISE!'
4. Count '1, 2, 3' and the PAX shouts the rep number

### Variations
- Oyo (On Your Own)

### Notes
If you mess up the count, the PAX will 'mumble chatter' you. Embrace it.
