### Definition
A workout style where the Q leads the group on a run, stopping at various 'pearls' for exercises.

### How it's done
The 'String' is the path or trail. The 'Pearls' are the stops (benches, light poles, parking spots). The Q stops the group, calls out an exercise in cadence, then leads the run to the next spot. Repeat until the loop is finished.

### Variations
- Reverse Pearls

### Notes
Great for AOs with lots of terrain or a long trail.
