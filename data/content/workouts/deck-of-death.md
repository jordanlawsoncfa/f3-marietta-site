### Definition
A workout where the exercises and reps are determined by the flip of a deck of playing cards.

### How it's done
Each suit is assigned an exercise (e.g., Hearts = Merkins). The number on the card is the number of reps. Face cards = 10, Aces = 15, Jokers = 20 Burpees. Q flips cards until the deck is gone.

### Variations
- Joker's Wild

### Notes
The unpredictability keeps the Mumble Chatter high.
