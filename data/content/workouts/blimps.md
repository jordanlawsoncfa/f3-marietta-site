BLIMPS are short for a 4-corners F3 workout that includes Burpees (For B), Lunges (For L), Imperial Walkers (For I), Plank-Jacks (For P), and Squats (For S) 

The way BLIMPS are typically executed are in ascending exercise reps by 10 per exercise. Example would be; 

PAX Moseys to a field with 4 corners.

All PAX start by doing 10 Burpees in each corner for a total of 40 Burpees.

Then start the 4 corners over doing 20 lunges for a total of 80 Squats.

Then start the 4 corners over doing 30 Imperial Walkers for 120 Imperial Walkers.

Then start the 4 corners over doing 40 Merkins for 160 total Merkins.

Then start the 4 corners over doing 50 Plank-Jacks for 200 Total Plank Jacks

Then start the 4 corners over doing 60 Squats for 240 total Squats.
