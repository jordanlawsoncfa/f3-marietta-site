# Mission and Core Principles

## The Mission
To plant, grow, and serve small workout groups for men for the invigoration of male community leadership.

## The 5 Core Principles
Every F3 workout must adhere to these five core principles:

1. **Free of charge:** There are no membership fees. You just show up.
2. **Open to all men:** No matter your age or fitness level, you are welcome.
3. **Held outdoors:** Rain or shine, heat or cold. We embrace the elements.
4. **Peer-led in a rotating fashion:** There are no certified instructors. We take turns leading (Q-ing) the workout.
5. **Ends with a Circle of Trust (COT):** A moment of reflection and connection at the end of the workout.

## The Credo
Leave no man behind, but leave no man where you found him.
