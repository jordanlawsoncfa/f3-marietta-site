# Your First Workout

## What to Expect
F3 workouts are boot-camp style workouts held outdoors. They typically last 45 minutes to an hour.

- **Arrival:** Arrive a few minutes early. Look for the shovel flag or a group of guys gathering in the parking lot.
- **The Gloom:** We often workout early in the morning, "in the gloom," before the rest of the world wakes up.
- **The Thang:** The workout itself. It will vary depending on the leader (the "Q"), but usually involves bodyweight exercises (pushups, burpees, squats) and running.
- **FNG:** If you are new, you are an "FNG" (Friendly New Guy). You will be welcomed warmly.
- **Naming:** At the end of your first workout, during the Circle of Trust, you will be given an F3 nickname by the group. This is your handle for all F3 activities.
