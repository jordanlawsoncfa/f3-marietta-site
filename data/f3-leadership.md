# Leadership (The Q)

In F3, leadership is taught by doing. We rotate leadership of the workouts so that every man has the opportunity to lead.

## The Q
The leader of a workout is called the "Q".
- The Q plans the workout.
- The Q leads the exercises and cadence.
- The Q is responsible for the safety and timing of the group.

## Virtuous Leader
F3 teaches the concept of the "Virtuous Leader". A Virtuous Leader is an Effective Leader who leads with love.
- **Effectiveness:** Getting the job done.
- **Virtue:** Doing the right thing.

We believe that by leading a workout, men build the confidence and skills to lead in their families, workplaces, and communities.
