                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                            F3 Marietta began in June 2024 with the launch of our first workout location (AO), "The Battlefield," at Marietta High School. What started as a small group of men gathering in the gloom has grown into a thriving community.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                            As our numbers grew, we expanded to include a second AO, "The Last Stand," adopted from the Alpha region. This growth signaled the readiness for Marietta to stand on its own as an official F3 Region.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                            Today, F3 Marietta serves men across the city, providing a place to get fit, find fellowship, and explore faith—all while developing the leadership skills needed to be better husbands, fathers, and community members.

                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                            We believe that men are suffering from a lack of connection and purpose. F3 provides a solution to the isolation many men face. By suffering together in a workout, we build bonds that allow us to support each other in all areas of life.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                            Our goal is to invigorate male community leadership. We want to see men stepping up to lead in their homes, their workplaces, their churches, and their neighborhoods.
